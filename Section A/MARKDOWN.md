## The following review is for Palindrome:

### Please make corrections as follows

- line 4: Please use a return statement to the false case.
- line 11: Please correct the spelling of the word "reversd" to "reversed".
- line 13: Pleaes change the comparison value to 0 perhaps at the moment num and x are the same value.
- line 23: Please use a return statement to the false case.
- line 25: Please use a return statement to the true case.

### Comments:

- In future to avoid such syntax errors I would suggest using the "Rubocop gem" as this would run through all of your code and correct the errors where possible.
